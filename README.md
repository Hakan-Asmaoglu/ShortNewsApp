# Project Overview

This project is an Android application that utilizes Jetpack Compose for UI development, follows a layered architecture combining UI, Data, and Dependency Injection (DI) layers, employs MVVM architecture with a modular approach, uses Coroutines & Flow for asynchronous programming, integrates Dagger-HILT for dependency injection, Retrofit for API calls, manages app state effectively, and incorporates custom Composable creation for UI elements.

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose for UI:** Utilizes Jetpack Compose for building the user interface, enabling a modern and declarative approach to UI development.

- **UI + DATA + DI Layers:** Organizes the project into separate layers for UI, Data, and Dependency Injection, facilitating a clear separation of concerns and better maintainability.

- **MVVM + Modular Architecture:** Adopts the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern for improved testability and separation of concerns. Additionally, implements a modular architecture to break down the application into independent modules for easier development and maintenance.

- **Coroutines & Flow:** Utilizes Kotlin Coroutines and Flow for asynchronous and reactive programming, allowing for efficient and non-blocking execution of concurrent tasks.

- **Dependency Injection with Dagger-HILT:** Integrates Dagger-HILT for dependency injection, enabling efficient management of dependencies and promoting modularization and reusability of code.

- **Retrofit for API Call:** Incorporates Retrofit library for making API calls, facilitating easy communication with backend services.

- **State Management:** Implements effective state management techniques to handle the application's state, ensuring a smooth user experience and preventing UI inconsistencies.

- **Custom Composable Creation:** Creates custom Composables to encapsulate UI components and functionalities, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
